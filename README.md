### 1. Abstract <a name="abstract"/>

The present repository contains simple algorithms wrotted using Python language. The initial idea was make quick start about that language. Here is eight ".py" files, named by exer-{some number}. To esily reference the algorithms, we call him just by number, for exemple, to say something about exer-1, the short documentation call this by 1. It solve some questions introduced by algorithms teacher, in Data Science course of Fatec Adamantina.

| 5 | Show the division rest about two number |
| 6 | Calculates the sphere area |
| 7 | Show output of two specific functions, one this of first degree and outher third degree follow respective formules:  `f(x) =  2x  + 1` and `f(x) = x³ - 2x² + x - 1` |
 | 8 | Calculates the circle area |
